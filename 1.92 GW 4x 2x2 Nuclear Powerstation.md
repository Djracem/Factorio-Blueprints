# 1.92 GW 4x 2x2 Nulcear Powerplant (Tileable w/modification)

Tons of better ways to do this, but this is the prettiest, imo, at least for my base! The blueprint uses blue belts, but yellow and red belts are able to be used in this, if you so desire. You can also convert this very easily into a bot-based design.

## FEATURES:
### 1.92 GW Max sustained power:
I modified the original blueprint from many moons ago now to do a 4x layout. This layout allows 1.92 GW max sustained power.

### Tileable:
I made this as tileable as possible. Well, as far as I cared to for now. All you'd have to do is extend the belts on down, and you'd be golden. The only issue that might arise is in the programming, but since the system is self-contained on each print, the most issue you'll have is confusing yourself for the reactor locations, but if you renumber both the PA speaker's announcements as well as the display units, it'll act like one big ol' giant single system.

### Automatic Fueling:

Nuclear power doesn't operate based on demand. If there is fuel in the powerplant, it is burning it. I've put in some logic to allow it to be as efficient as possible without risking a cool-down situation. At any point in time, if there is a sudden spike in demand, it will always be able to both satisfy that demand and rise to temperature quickly enough to prevent any type of stall. This allows you to get far greater efficiency.

### Higher Efficiency:

A reactor this size might turn you off from the consumption, but due to the programming, it's incredibly efficient based on demand at any given moment. I've calculated and run tests, and came to these numbers:

Full load (1.92 GW): ~5 fuel cells/minute (Cold starting will almost double this for about a minute, though)

3/4 load (1.44 GW): ~4/m

1/2 load (960 MW): ~3/m

1/4 load (480 MW): ~2/m

### Audio-Visual Auto-Alert:

Once you fuel it for the first time, that reactor group becomes "initialized." After this, if there is any point in time in which your fuel supply runs out and your reactor starts cooling below a safe amount to where, under peak load, you start dropping power, this system will automatically notify you that you have a malfunction.

An audio alert will sound (removable by deleting the PA speaker in the center area) notifying you that one or more of your reactors is entering an uncontrollable cooldown to where the auto-fueling system cannot remediate. Based on how many reactor groups are malfunctioning, the volume of the alert will change.

In combination with that, each reactor group is labeled both with a display unit and with its own PA speaker (that has been muted). Your alerts bar will tell you exactly which reactor group is malfunctioning and display a red light on the reactor(s) that are causing the problem.

## Bugs? Comments? Questions? Requests?

Please, send a push request if anything is broken or malfunctioning, and I'll do my best to remediate the issue as quickly as possible. I can't promise anything, but I'll sure try! Alternatively, feel free to contact me on Discord using the same username. I am in the Factorio Blueprints discord server, as well.

Cheers!
